- think of ways to reduce number of enqueued events
- think of parallelization method (domain decomp? Related to above point?)

- write post-processor
  - simpleMD_postprocessor
  - use class Timg_FrameRenderer : public FrameRenderer {};
  - someday implement class Povray_FrameRenderer : public FrameRenderer {};
  - virtual parent class to define interface

- Documentation....code is poorly commented at this point
